One of the most important aspect of Datascience is Regular Expressions or REGEX.
Regex can be used to search, extract, validate, or transform text based on specified patterns such as extracting Years from a Wikipedia page or extracting numbers of particular time maybe 
Roman Expressions or Co-ordinates format or Date-Time format and extracting text strings of particular type.
It is important to learn Regular Expressions due to its wide applications in Natural Language Processing(NLP),
Web Scraping and Data Mining used by Machine Learning Engineers and Data Analysts inorder to get relevant and useful data from other website sources. 
Having worked extensively in  Navigation Data as an Aeronautical Data Analyst I tried using Regular Expression concepts to extract data for USA Aerodromes from FAA Aeronautical Data website.

**Conclusion:**
Countries nowadays are moving to digital formats of Navigation database although the format is electronic pdf but in future we might have dynamic websites such as FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) 
which provides Unites States database in HTML content format and regular expression framework could be very useful.
